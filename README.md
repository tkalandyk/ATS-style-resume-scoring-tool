## What is CandidateFit AI?

CandidateFit AI is an **ATS-style resume scoring tool** that helps job seekers understand how well their resume matches a job description. It provides:

- **Transparent scoring** (0-100) with detailed breakdowns
- **AI-powered suggestions** for resume improvements
- **Keyword gap analysis** showing what's missing
- **Downloadable HTML reports** for your records

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike black-box ATS systems, CandidateFit AI shows you *exactly* why you lost points and how to fix it.

---

## The Problem It Solves

**Job seekers face a challenge:** Most resumes are filtered by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before a human ever sees them. But ATS systems are opaque - you don't know:

- Why your resume was rejected
- What keywords are missing
- How to improve your match score
- Which skills or tools to emphasize

**CandidateFit AI solves this** by simulating ATS scoring with full transparency.

---

## How It Works (3-Step Flow)

### Step 1: Input
- **Paste your resume text** (no file upload needed - just copy/paste)
- **Paste the job description** from the posting
- *Optional:* Enter target role title for better AI suggestions

### Step 2: Analysis
The app analyzes your resume across 5 dimensions:

1. **Skills Match (30%)** - Do you have the required skill categories?
2. **Tools Match (20%)** - Do you mention the required tools/technologies?
3. **Keyword Coverage (20%)** - How many JD keywords appear in your resume?
4. **Experience/Impact (20%)** - Do you show quantified results and strong action verbs?
5. **Structure/Formatting (10%)** - Does your resume have proper sections and formatting?

### Step 3: Results
You get a comprehensive dashboard with:
- **Overall score** (weighted average of 5 subscores)
- **Subscore breakdown** with visual progress bars
- **Point-loss reasons** (exactly why you lost points)
- **Keyword gaps** (missing vs. present keywords)
- **AI-powered suggestions** (rewritten bullets, new content ideas)
- **Downloadable HTML report**

---

## Scoring Algorithm (Transparent & Deterministic)

### Overall Score Formula
```
Overall Score = (Skills × 0.30) + (Tools × 0.20) + (Keywords × 0.20) 
                + (Experience × 0.20) + (Structure × 0.10)
```

### 1. Skills Match (30% weight)

**What it measures:** Percentage of required skill categories found in your resume

**How it works:**
- Extracts skill categories from JD (e.g., "Risk Management", "Cloud Security")
- Matches against 15 predefined skill categories with synonyms
- Calculates: (Matched Categories / JD Categories) × 100

**Example:**
- JD requires: Risk Management, Compliance, Cloud Security, Incident Response
- Resume has: Risk Management, Compliance, Incident Response
- Score: (3/4) × 100 = **75/100**

**Why it matters:** ATS systems prioritize skill matching above all else

---

### 2. Tools Match (20% weight)

**What it measures:** Percentage of required tools/technologies found in your resume

**How it works:**
- Extracts tools from JD (e.g., "Splunk", "Jira", "AWS")
- Matches against 30+ tools with variations (e.g., "AWS" = "Amazon Web Services")
- Calculates: (Matched Tools / JD Tools) × 100

**Example:**
- JD requires: Splunk, Tenable, Jira, AWS, Azure
- Resume has: Splunk, Tenable, AWS
- Score: (3/5) × 100 = **60/100**

**Why it matters:** Technical roles heavily weight specific tool experience

---

### 3. Keyword Coverage (20% weight)

**What it measures:** How many important JD keywords appear in your resume

**How it works:**
- Uses TF-IDF to extract top 50 keywords from JD
- Focuses on top 20 most important keywords
- Calculates overlap with resume keywords
- Score: (Overlapping Keywords / Top 20 JD Keywords) × 100

**Example:**
- Top 20 JD keywords: "security", "risk", "compliance", "audit", etc.
- Resume contains: 15 of these keywords
- Score: (15/20) × 100 = **75/100**

**Why it matters:** Keyword matching is the foundation of ATS filtering

---

### 4. Experience/Impact (20% weight)

**What it measures:** Quantified impact metrics + strong action verbs

**How it works:**
- **Metrics (50 points max):** Counts numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, time saved
- **Action Verbs (50 points max):** Counts unique strong verbs (implemented, managed, led, etc.)
- Combines both for total score

**Example:**
- Resume has 8 quantified metrics → 24 points
- Resume has 6 unique action verbs → 36 points
- Score: 24 + 36 = **60/100**

**Why it matters:** ATS favors results-oriented language over vague responsibilities

---

### 5. Structure/Formatting (10% weight)

**What it measures:** Resume organization and readability

**How it works:**
- **Section Detection (60 points):** Checks for Experience, Skills, Education, Certifications
- **Formatting Quality (40 points):** Bullet points, line length, paragraph length, special characters

**Example:**
- Has Experience, Skills, Education sections → 40 points
- Has bullet points, good formatting → 35 points
- Score: 40 + 35 = **75/100**

**Why it matters:** Well-structured resumes parse better in ATS systems

---

## AI-Powered Suggestions (OpenAI Integration)

### What the AI Does
- **Rewrites existing bullets** with stronger action verbs and metrics
- **Suggests new bullets** tailored to the job description
- **Recommends keyword integration** naturally into your content
- **Identifies missing sections** you should add

### What the AI Does NOT Do
- **Does NOT affect your score** (scoring is 100% deterministic)
- **Does NOT invent experience** (only suggests if you have relevant background)
- **Does NOT work without API key** (falls back to template suggestions)

### Example AI Output
**Before:**
> Worked on security projects and helped with compliance

**After:**
> Led implementation of ISO 27001 compliance framework, reducing audit findings by 40% and achieving certification 2 months ahead of schedule
